# Overview
Our projects aims to identify and respond to port scans against one or more systems from one or more systems. The project implements a neural net designed to catch slower passive scans, fast aggressive scans, horizontal scans against many systems, and vertical scans against a single system using potentially spoofed addresses. Based on the results from the neural net, our system would alarm and activate other applications to protect the system against scans. Our projects aims to develops a detection system that identifies scans earlier, and detects stealthy scans that slip past existing port scan detection software.

# Process
![System architecture](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1RNIRRjpCY45OXpBxJLRGVe2dGiWd20gSED2H-Dn1qjk/pub?w=960&h=720)
Our system consists of four parts: the collection agent, the detection agent, the response agent, and a database. 
The collection agent captures all packets entering a system, and logs relevant information about the packets to the database. These pieces of information are:
- Destination port
- Destination address
- Source address
- Time arrived
- Time to live
- ~~Result of Snort check for malicious packets (assuming this does not slow down too far)~~

Once the collection agent has reached a threshold, either n packets entering the collection agent or n seconds passing by, the collection agent will create a set of unique source address from the packets it has collected. For each unique source address, it places a job in to the detection agent’s queue.

The detection agent pulls jobs off its queue, and pulls all related packets from the database for the source address. It then calculates several features about the packet data, and enters those features into the neural net for classification. These features are:

1. Seen subnet scan before
2. Number of irregular ports (not traditionally running services)
3. Average time between different ports
4. Number of ports in n seconds
5. Ratio of packets to number of ports
6. Average TTL of packets from same source
7. Difference between max and min TTL
8. ~~A bias on where the traffic came from geographically.~~(IP to geo currently not supported)
9. ~~Number of flagged packets~~ (Snort integration not supported)
10. ~~A count of the number of ports that the screening system found to be undesirable.  Malformed packets/empty payloads/etc.~~ (Snort integration not supported)

If the neural net detects a port scan, a job is placed on the response agent’s queue containing the source address of the attacker.

The response agent pulls jobs off its queue and logs the relevant information. It then activates any number of scripts to further protect the system, including blocking the scanning system or trying to identify further information about the attacker. Our system is designed to allow multiple response agents to be running in parallel, allowing the system to scale up to an attack load.

# Data
We plan to collect our own data on a local network. One server will act as the scanned system, while additionally providing regular services and creating normal traffic by communicating with some number of clients. A separate system on a different local network will scan the primary system with multiple port scanning softwares. We will store the regular traffic and the scanned traffic in pcap files. The regular traffic will either be of moderate volume or of heavy volume. Each scanning software will create multiple scanning traffic pcap files. Every scanning traffic file will be merge in with every regular traffic file so that the scans appear to have occurred at some point during the regular traffic.
This means that each scanning software will produce some number of scans (S) and be matched with each regular traffic (R). Assuming each software supports vertical and horizontal scans, and passive and aggressive scans, that means there are four ways for each software to scan (4S). Assuming each scan is matched to no traffic, moderate traffic, and heavy traffic (3R), then there will be 12*S*R total scans to train on. We will set R at a relatively high number (R>1000) in order to avoid overfitting. Our training and testing sets for the neural net will contain an equal percentage of each type of scan from each type of scanning software matched with each type of background traffic.

# Evaluation
We will measure the effectiveness by examining the rate at which we get false positives and false negatives, compared to other existing softwares. Additionally, we will compare the speed at which we detect the scan, and at what volume of traffic our software begins to slow down.
